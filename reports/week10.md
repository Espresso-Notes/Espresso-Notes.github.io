The text editor is now in a functional state, with many of the formatting working as intened.
Text within the editor can be saved as an HTML file to be later loaded back in to be edited again, or exported as a DOCX file.
Work has begun on deciding how the final UI elements will look.
Currently, there is no support for code blocks, which is a large part of our project. I am looking into a few potential modules that could help achieve this and expect to have it implemented in the coming week.
Along with the code blocks, I look to have markdown support implemented.
